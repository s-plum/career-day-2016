1. Clone the repo.
2. From the command line, navigate into the repo root directory and run `npm install`.
3. Once all dependencies are installed, run `gulp serve`.

To build and preview at the same time, run `gulp serve --watch`. Always make edits to styles, Javascript, and images in the `src` directory. Audio and video files should be saved directly into the appropriate folder in the `public` directory.
